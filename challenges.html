        <h1>30-Day Challenges</h1>
        <p>
          A 30-day challenge is a bootcamp for your brain. It gives you a clear goal, a defined time frame, and a built-in accountability system. It breaks you out of your comfort zone and helps you try something new, without the pressure of a lifelong commitment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participating in a 30-day challenge is a valuable technique for hacking your brain into doing something good for you (and/or weird) that you otherwise might have trouble doing.

            <p>
              How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself and in no instance bypass the
              discriminations of reason? You have been given the principles that you ought to endorse, and you have
              endorsed them. What kind of teacher, then, are you still waiting for in order to refer your
              self-improvement to him? You are no longer a boy, but a full-grown man. If you are careless and lazy now
              and keep putting things off and always deferring the day after which you will attend to yourself, you will
              not notice that you are making no progress, but you will live and die as someone quite ordinary.
            </p>
            <p>
              From now on, then, resolve to live as a grown-up who is making progress, and make whatever you think best
              a law that you never set aside. And whenever you encounter anything that is difficult or pleasurable, or
              highly or lowly regarded, remember that the contest is now: you are at the Olympic Games, you cannot wait
              any longer, and that your progress is wrecked or preserved by a single day and a single event. That is how
              Socrates fulfilled himself by attending to nothing except reason in everything he encountered. And you,
              although you are not yet a Socrates, should live as someone who at least wants to be a Socrates.

            dignity, and feeling of affection, and freedom, and justice; and to give thyself relief from all other
            thoughts. And thou wilt give thyself relief, if thou doest every act of thy life as if it were the last,
            laying aside all carelessness and passionate aversion from the commands of reason, and all hypocrisy, and
            self-love, and discontent with the portion which has been given to thee. Thou seest how few the things are,
            the which if a man lays hold of, he is able to live a life which flows in quiet, and is like the existence
            of the gods; for the gods on their part will require nothing more from him who observes these things."
