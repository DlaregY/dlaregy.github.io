# GeraldNorby.com v2 (Retro Beta)

This folder contains a full-site redesign experiment inspired by retro interfaces.

## Goals
- Mirror the main pages of the classic site while preserving information.
- Provide switchable DOS and NES inspired themes.
- Keep accessibility, keyboard support, and responsive behavior.

## Assumptions
- Classic pages remain unchanged except for a single link from `index.html` into this beta.
- Content is mirrored manually in v2 HTML so it can be served as plain static files.
- Book recommendation data is sourced from existing `assets/js/books.js`.
